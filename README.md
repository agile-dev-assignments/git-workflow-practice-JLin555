I found this article interesting because it proposes an interesting issue regarding the term "agile". The article argues that managers and developers are using the term incorrectly and are trying to evolve the meaning of "agile" in software developing. Citing the original agile manifesto, the article reminds readers that the original idea of "agile" is quite simple and that it shouldn't be tossed around so lightly.
